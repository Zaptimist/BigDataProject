(2) for each addition, include on a separate line an entry of the form:

     <name>|<title>|<attributes>|<character name>|<order>

    where:

     <name> is the actors name in <surname>, <firstname> order. Please note
            the space after the comma as in: "Grant, Cary".

             appeared, please include the year of release as part of the title
             (see examples below).

     <attributes> records any award nominations or wins and in most cases will
                  be empty. Example attributes include:

       (AA)           = academy award winner (best actor)
       (AAN)          = academy award nominee (best actor)
       (S:AA)         = academy award winner (best supporting actor)
       (S:AAN)        = academy award nominee (best supporting actor)
       (GG)           = golden globe winner (best drama actor)
       (GGN)          = golden globe nominee (best drama actor)

     <character name>  is the character name of the actor.

     <order> is a number to record the position in which the actor appears in
             the credits (1=star billing)

    The full additions guide contains more information on the formats. 

    Notes:

     - Apart from the <name> and <title> all these fields are optional, but
       please leave the "|" separator for any blank fields, otherwise the some
       of the data may be lost.

     - Guest appearances in TV-series are NOT eligible for the main actors and
       actresses list. The person must have played a recurring role across a 
       number of episodes in order to be included. See the section describing
       the biography database for an alternative method of adding this type of 
       information.

     - Please only credit individual names. For example, if all the members of
       a particular rock group appeared in a movie then include them under 
       their individual names and not the name of the whole group.

     - The actors and actresses sections are for people only. No animals.
